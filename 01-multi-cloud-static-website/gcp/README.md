# GCP Implementation - Static Website

## 🎯 GCP Services Used
- **Cloud Storage**: Static website hosting
- **Cloud CDN**: Global content delivery
- **Cloud DNS**: DNS management
- **SSL Certificates**: Managed SSL certificates
- **Cloud Build**: CI/CD deployment

## 🏗️ Architecture
```plaintext
[GitHub] → [Cloud Storage] → [Cloud CDN] → [User]
                       ↳ [SSL Certificate]
                       ↳ [Cloud DNS]
```

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Google Cloud Platform account with billing enabled
- Domain name (optional, can use Cloud CDN domain)
- GitHub repository for source code

## 🚀 Deployment Steps
1. Configure gcloud CLI
2. Run Terraform to provision infrastructure
3. Upload website content to Cloud Storage
4. Configure Cloud Build for CI/CD

## 💰 Cost Estimation
- Cloud Storage: ~$0.020 per GB/month
- Cloud CDN: ~$0.08 per GB (first 10TB)
- Cloud DNS: ~$0.20 per zone/month
- SSL Certificates: Free (Google-managed)
