# AWS Implementation - Static Website

## 🎯 AWS Services Used
- **Amazon S3**: Static website hosting
- **CloudFront**: Global CDN distribution
- **AWS Certificate Manager**: Free SSL/TLS certificates
- **Route 53**: DNS management
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD deployment

## 🏗️ Architecture
```plaintext
[GitHub] → [S3 Bucket] → [CloudFront] → [User]
                   ↳ [ACM HTTPS Certificate]
                   ↳ [Route 53 DNS]
```

## 📋 Prerequisites
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Domain name (optional, can use CloudFront domain)
- GitHub repository for source code

## 🚀 Deployment Steps
1. Configure AWS credentials
2. Run Terraform to provision infrastructure
3. Upload website content to S3
4. Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## 💰 Cost Estimation
- S3: ~$0.023 per GB/month
- CloudFront: ~$0.085 per GB (first 10TB)
- Route 53: ~$0.50 per hosted zone/month
- ACM: Free
