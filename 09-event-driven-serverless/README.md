# Project 9: Event-Driven Serverless Architecture

## 🎯 Objective
Create **serverless image processing pipelines** triggered by cloud storage uploads across providers.

## 🧱 Architecture
**AWS**: S3 + Lambda + SNS/SQS + S3 Output  
**GCP**: Cloud Storage + Cloud Functions + Pub/Sub + Cloud Storage Output  
**Azure**: Blob Storage + Azure Functions + Service Bus + Blob Storage Output  

## 💡 App Idea
Multi-cloud serverless image thumbnail generator
