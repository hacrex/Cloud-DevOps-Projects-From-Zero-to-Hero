# Project 3: Infrastructure as Code Across Clouds

## 🎯 Objective
Recreate your entire 3-tier architecture using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** across multiple cloud providers.

**AWS**: Terraform AWS Provider + S3 Backend + DynamoDB State Lock  
**GCP**: Terraform Google Provider + Cloud Storage Backend + Cloud Firestore State Lock  
**Azure**: Terraform AzureRM Provider + Storage Account Backend + Cosmos DB State Lock  

## 💡 App Idea
Automate Project #2 deployment across all three cloud providers
